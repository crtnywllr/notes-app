# Note Keeper

**Live demo**: (https://limitless-reef-83019.herokuapp.com)

**Purpose:**  This was my final project for Thinkful's Career Path bootcamp. I wanted to try to create an environment mimicking a work setting where I might receive design and back-end structure from others and need to add front end functionality, so I chose to use a template and Firebase as my starting structure. This taught me exactly what I wanted it to - how to solve errors on my own and using Google and how to tease what I need out of sometimes unclear documentation.

The inspiration for making this app in the first place was to create something I would use to keep track of my own client roster and notes, as well as something that my friends who work in this field might benefit from.

**Technologies used**: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, DataTables, JavaScript, jQuery, Firebase

**Known bugs**: None as of July 2016
